I am an aspiring social-good engineer with a penchant for data science, IoT, and product; with an infectious enthusiasm for technology and innovation, I hope to one day be a polymath.

I am a sophomore Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University] with a Software System concentration advised by [Professor David O'Hallaron]. This summer, I am in Chicago interning at [Groupon] as Technical Product Manager for their Supply Intelligence and Dynamic Pricing teams. Check [this] out!

In Fall 2017, I will be doing research in Deep Reinforcement Learning under [Professor José Moura]. Last semester, I worked on [Intelligent Pothole Detection] under the guidance of [Professor Zico Kolter].
