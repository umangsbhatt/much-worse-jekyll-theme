I am an aspiring social-good engineer with a penchant for data science, IoT, and community service, with an infectious enthusiasm for technology and innovation, and with a dream to one day be a polymath.

I am a sophomore Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University] with a Software System concentration advised by [Professor David O'Hallaron]. Currently, I am doing research in Intelligent Pothole Detection under the guidance of [Professor Zico Kolter]. This summer I will be in Chicago interning at [Groupon] as Technical Product Manager for their Supply Intelligence and Dynamic Pricing teams.
